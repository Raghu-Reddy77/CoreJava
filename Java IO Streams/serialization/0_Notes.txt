Serialization: Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, 
which can be easily saved to a file or transmitted over a network. It allows objects to 
be persisted and reconstructed later.

Serialization Mechanism: Java provides two main classes, 
ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream, to serialize and deserialize objects 
respectively. These classes handle the conversion between objects and byte streams.
